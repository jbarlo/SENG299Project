# Go Web Application

A Go Web App developed by Group 13 as a requirement of SENG 299 at the University of Victoria in Summer 2016.
This application is able to play against an external web service developed by Simon Diemert, which can be downloaded at: https://github.com/sdiemert/goai.git

##Set Up 

###Remote Access
In order to be able to use this application, it is necessary to either be using the engineering network directly, or connected via VPN. 
Remote is accessible at: http://www.uvic.ca/systems/services/internettelephone/remoteaccess/

###Dependencies
Please ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed: 
``npm install``


###NodeJS 
This application requires both NodeJS and Node Package Manager(npm) to be installed. 
NodeJS: https://nodejs.org/en/
npm: https://www.npmjs.com

###Running the Server
Navigate to the working directory in the command window using the prompt: 
``mypath/SENG299Project``

Use the command ``npm start`` to start the server.

The message: ``Listening on port 3000`` will appear in the command prompt window when the server is running successfully.

###Opening the App
By default, navigate to: localhost:3000 in your web browser to view the app, and play Go!
This port number is likely changed when running on the UVic Roberts Server.

*Note: In order to play in AI mode, it is necessary to either be directly in the UVic engineering network, or using remote access*
